# Adapted from https://mmazzarolo.com/blog/2022-09-09-visual-regression-testing-with-playwright-and-github-actions/#updating-the-snapshots-in-ci-with-a-pull-request-comment
# This workflow's goal is forcing an update of the reference snapshots used
# by Playwright tests. It runs whenever you post a new pull request comment
# that strictly matches the "/update-snapshots".
# From a high-level perspective, it works like this:
# 1. Because of a GitHub Action limitation, this workflow is triggered on every
#    comment posted on a issue or pull request. We manually interrupt it unless
#    the comment content strictly matches "/update-snapshots" and we're in a
#    pull request.
# 2. Use the GitHub API to grab the information about the branch name and SHA of
#    the latest commit of the current pull request.
# 3. Update the Playwright reference snapshots based on the UI of this branch.
# 4. Commit the newly generated Playwright reference snapshots into this branch.
