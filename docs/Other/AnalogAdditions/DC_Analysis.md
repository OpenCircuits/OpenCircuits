# DC Analysis
1. Performing Analysis when DC Sources are Used
    * DC sources mean all sources should be applying a constant current/voltage.
    * This Analysis would be similar to running with "DC Operating Point" in LTSpice
2. This Analysis Can Not be Validly Performed with Time-Varying Signals
    * Output results should be invalid as it makes no sense to have time-varying signals in a DC Analysis.
3. Linear (IV-curve) Components Have their Properties Determined According to Simple Linear Equations
    * These include Resistors whose properties are dictated by Ohm's Law (V = I*R).
4. Nonlinear Components Could have their DC Steady State Values Reported
    * These components include Inductors and Capacitors whose voltages/currents will change with time even as a DC signal is applied to them
    * A DC Analysis essentially take the limit as time goes to infinity in these instances, resulting in reporting the "DC Steady States" of these components. These will be DC values that reflect the values which properties of these components wil always be moving closer towards.
