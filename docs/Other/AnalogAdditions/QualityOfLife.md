# Future Quality of Life Improvements
1. Example Circuits
    * Updated Example Analog Circuits would help get new users started
    * These circuits could be loaded in for users to be able to mess around with running the simulation
    * We included samples of Voltage Divider, Series RC (Resistor-Capacitor), Series RL (Resistor-Inductor), and Series RLC (Resistor-Capacitor-Inductor) circuits.
2. Implementing Keyboard Shortcuts
    * Users would be able to quickly and easily bring up commonly used components using keyboard shortcuts
    * These shortcuts should correspond with their associated components (i.e. "v" for Voltage Source)
3. Display Component Values Next to Their Models
    * Resistances, capacitance values, inductance values, and all values for sources should be shown next to or near the associatedd components
4. Wires and Components Should Automatically Snap into Positions
    * Wires should naturally snap to 90 degree angles so wirings for more complicated circuits can be less confusing
5. Deleting the Oscilloscope
    * Currently, removing the Oscilloscope also deletes all attached wires which should not be the case.
6. Uploading Your Own Components/Models
    * Expand functionalities and component libraries by allowing users to uploaded pre-formatted circuit component files that can be parsed into actual usable models.
    * This can include modeling specific real-world components if the data reflects that components (expected) behaviors.
