### Running

See [running](./Running#frontend)

### Unit Tests

## Submitting your code

Make sure your code passes all [linting](./Running#linting) without any errors or warning. Code with an error or warning will not be merged.

Before submitting â€“ always make sure to build and run unit tests (we won't merge any request that fails Travis CI)

Pushing directly to the master branch is prohibited so if you make changes put it on a new branch and make a pull request to have your changes merged into master after being reviewed.

## Old Code

If you're working on part of the refactor, it can be very helpful to reference some of the old code.

[Here](https://github.com/OpenCircuits/OpenCircuits/tree/ac87b95e083cacec5dd83c10526e6ac7d03ff253/old_site) is a link to the old directory.
