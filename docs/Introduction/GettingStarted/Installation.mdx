import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';


## Requirements

* **Make sure you have [`Git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed**

* **Note: before installing new packages, make sure your current packages are up-to-date to avoid conflicts.**
___


OpenCircuits uses **yarn** to manage building and testing with dependencies.
Yarn is a superset of NPM and is the recommended manager.

Additionally, we use **Golang** as our backend language.
Choose your system below for instructions on installing these.


<Tabs groupId="system"
      defaultValue="win"
      values={[
          {label: "Windows", value: "win"},
          {label: "macOS", value: "mac"},
          {label: "Linux", value: "linux"},
          {label: "Docker", value: "docker"},
      ]}>

<TabItem value="win">
{/*         */}
{/* WINDOWS */}
{/*         */}

:::note
It's highly recommended to use (the admittedly terrible) built-in Command Prompt.
We have yet to find a working solution with WSL, but please feel free to let us know if you figure it out!
:::

#### NPM

[Install the LTS version of npm here](https://nodejs.org/en/) and make sure it works by typing `npm --version` in the command prompt.

(Note: after installing it make sure to restart command prompt so that the command gets recognized)

Then, to install Yarn, run
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

And again, make sure it works by typing `yarn --version`.

:::warning
*If you run into* `ERR: cb.apply is not a function:` [*click here*](https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues/2874#issuecomment-663661148)
:::

#### Go

Download and run the MSI installer [here](https://golang.org/dl/)

Restart command prompt and verify that it worked by typing `go version`.

</TabItem>


<TabItem value="mac">
{/*       */}
{/* macOS */}
{/*       */}

#### Homebrew

:::note

We highly recommend installing [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as it makes life much easier.
And we will assume you have it installed for the rest of these instructions.

:::

#### NPM / Yarn

To install NPM, simply run
```bash
brew install npm
```

Make sure it works by typing `npm --version` in the terminal.

Then, to install Yarn, run
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

And again, make sure it works by typing `yarn --version`.

#### Go

To install type the following line:

`brew install go`

Verify that it works by typing `go version`

</TabItem>


<TabItem value="linux">
{/*       */}
{/* LINUX */}
{/*       */}

#### NPM

:::note
If you're using Ubuntu you may need to uninstall the built-in "yarn" from `cmdtest`, by doing
```bash
sudo apt-get remove cmdtest
```
:::

* For Ubuntu, type `sudo apt-get install nodejs`

* For Arch-based distributions, install the `npm` package from the `community` repository.

* For gLinux, you must first install NVM (Node Version Manager) via `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash`
    Make sure this works by doing `nvm --version`
    Then do `nvm install node` and you should be all set up!

After installing, verify that it works by typing `npm --version`

Then, to install Yarn, run
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

And again, make sure it works by typing `yarn --version`.


#### Go

To install, follow the instructions [here](https://golang.org/doc/install#tarball)

After installing, verify that it works by typing `go version`

</TabItem>


<TabItem value="docker">
{/*        */}
{/* DOCKER */}
{/*        */}
